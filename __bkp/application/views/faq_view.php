  <p class="style3">WHAT ARE PODS AND GROUPS</p>
  <p><strong>9. What are PODS and Groups?</strong></p>
  <p>Here at Tellitize, you may add your High School, Employer, or any other place that your daily life consist of. We have termed these as Places of Discussions (PODS). Groups may also be added. A group is anything that cannot be classifed as a Place. Such as a belief or organization.</p>
  <p>In each Group or POD you add, you may also add names of people that you know whom are associated with that Group or POD. You may Tellitize them from within the Groups and PODS. Emails will be generated to them if you know their email address. Also, when a person with the same name joins Tellitize, it will ask them if they are associated with they Group or POD and they have the ability to Join as well. You will be alerted by email when this occurs. </p>
  <p class="style3">SOMETHING WAS POSTED ABOUT ME THAT I WANT REMOVED</p>
  <p><strong>10. There is something on Tellitize that I think is about me and I would like it removed from the website. Is this possible?</strong></p>
  <p>Certainly, please use the Contact Us page to alert us of the post. We strictly prohibit bullying and it will not be tolerated. Removal of false claims and accusations will be considered as well. </p>
