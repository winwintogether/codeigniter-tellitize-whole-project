				<p><strong>About Tellitize    </strong></p>
				<p>Everyone's day usually consists of other people, places, and a host of topics.
				  
				  Here at TelliTize, you may speak your mind about these people and places. You can post as YOURSELF or ANONYMOUSLY so that nobody will ever know who created the post. Constructive criticism is sometimes very productive and we intend our website to help people be the best they can be. They may not realize they are doing things wrong. Whether it be in the workplace, or in everyday life. Let's bring their shortcomings and strong points to light so they can see their public perception.</p>
				<p> TelliTize somebody today! </p>
